So this is based on a nethack style dungeon to some extent
also on the anime "tower / dungeon" theme
also DnD

So I could try to simulate out all limbs and stuff.
but maybe that's more complicated than necessary?
but it could be cool though

Ok, so the world is:
- many generated levels (like 20?)
- progressive levels are harder
- each level has many entrances and many exits. Each night, with some probability, exits close and open elsewhere.
  - those who have already traversed a level sometimes sell their maps
- people need to go back to the surface to sleep

- there's a specified amount of monsters of various levels on a given level. when a monster is killed, another one crawls out of one of the monster holes scattered around the level (after a short time).
- monsters fight each other too, if they're of different kinds.

- adventurers team up into teams, they help each other, etc. like dnd.

turn by turn

in order to continue, adventurers need to get enough loot each day to buy room & board, and get better armor and weapons and potions and stuff.

what's loot?
well, monster parts that you bring back to sell.
I guess we could go with the "core" bit, that each monster has a core that animates it.
and you collect cores.
I mean
I guess it works

monsters have weak points, which you can aim for, probably.

ugh is this even good


i could go back to "small town life" or something.
