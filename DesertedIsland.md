"deserted island"? That could be interesting.
survival, yeah.

that seems far less contrived.
you hunt, you gather. and there's a forgotten palace.

there's some exchange between people.

# How do people arrive?
- plane crash
- shipwreck

How do people find out about the palace?
- ruins?
- maps in the ruins
- old journals of other adventurers

# What's the goal?
- the person who gets the massive gem and gets off alive is the winner

# Features
- people leave tracks that trackers can follow
- I think I'll do a grid? tracks will indicate where it was fron and where it's going. tracks fade, and the speed that they fade varies depending on the type of ground.
- if a track is trodden multiple times, it becomes a trail (can also fade, but fades slower)
- knowledge is modeled:
  - where things are (geographic features, landmarks)
  - what species of plan & animal exist on the island
  - other people's attributes
  - past experiences of self and others
    - actually maybe this is the unifying thing?

Do we do relationships?
- yes
- relationships are based on shared experience
- getting betrayed makes you like an individual less, and all people a little less
- getting helped makes you like an individual more, and all people a little more
- division of labor, planning -- how to do it?

# Needs
- food
- warmth
- shelter from elements
- clothing? maybe don't worry about that just yet.

# Food sources
- plants
- animals

# Crafting
- flint & steel? everyone has a pocketknife? could be
- weapons? for hunting & defense? (bow&arrow, club?, spear. yeah that's probably the size of it.)

learning to craft stuff takes time.
inventing something is much harder than copying something already there.

- fiber from large leaves & the inside of tree bark.



Umm so maybe I could think of it as one of those old text adventures
